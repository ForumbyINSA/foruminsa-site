Its teaching, tied to the most recent scientific advances, is strongly based on
the activity of [leading research
laboratories](https://www.insa-toulouse.fr/fr/recherche/labo.html), supported
by large industrial groups, in the field of new materials for aeronautics, for
example, environmental preservation technologies or nano-objects.


` `  
` `  

The international aspect has been a priority for the school since its creation,
which has gradually set up international courses. On campus, one in five
students is foreign.


` `  
` `  

The promotions welcome students with diverse profiles: technological
baccalaureate holders, engineers in
[apprenticeship](https://www.insa-toulouse.fr/fr/formation/ingenieur/apprentissage-1.html)
and [continuous
education](https://www.insa-toulouse.fr/fr/formation/formation_continue.html).
Openness to the world also means the civic engagement of students, strongly
supported and valued within the school system.
